# Write a program to read in a Python variable and print "Valid" if it is a valid Python variable and
# "Invalid" otherwise. For this exercise, you can assume that Python keywords do not exist, i.e.
# you donâ€™t have to check against them.

# Check if the first character is a letter or underscore
if not (('a' <= variable_name[0] <= 'z') or ('A' <= variable_name[0] <= 'Z') or (variable_name[0] == '_')):

    for char in variable_name:
